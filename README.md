# Predicting the quality of red wine from Ph, Alcohol(vol%), residual sugar(g/dm^3) and sulphates(g/dm^3)

Red wine is an alcoholic drink with varying properties that depend on the fermentation process and varieties of grape used to create it (Watrelot et al., 2019). Because of this variety there is a large range of quality for red wines.

This project will determine if the quality of red wine can be accurately predicted using Ph, Alcohol(vol%), residual sugar(g/dm^3) and sulphates(g/dm^3). The dataset used to answer this question has the variables of multiple red wine samples and the quality score it was given. The score is from 0-10 and where a score > 6.5 is considered good quality. To maximize the reach of this project ph, alcohol, residual sugar and sulphates were chosen as the predictive variables they are the aspects of wine most casual wine drinkers would likely be familiar with.
